# 5/3/1 Progression Tracker

This is a tool for people running a 5/3/1 progression on a lift or following a 5/3/1 program. Users are asked to provide a name and the most amount of weight they can lift for an exercise they would like to track. This app programmatically creates a 4 week schedule to increase the lift based on a popular schedule/method known as a 5/3/1 progression created by Jim Wendler. Users can also keep notes and reminders for a given exercise and track what week they are on.
